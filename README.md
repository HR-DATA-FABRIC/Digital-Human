# Digital-Humans
How can global digital platforms scale their world-wide services to meet people's needs & wants, within the context of the human condition? Creative industries are addressing this seemingly paradox by developing agent-based solutions [---digital humans---](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF2u7RTPsHI&t=71s) such as intelligent assistants, voice bots and smart objects that can converse convincingly with people  thanks to recent advances in AI-technologies. A prime example of a digital human is the [re:scam-bot](https://www.ddb.co.nz/#rescam) by [Netsafe](https://netsafe.org.nz/scam-tips/#:~:text=Netsafe's%20Guide%20to%20Scam%20Spotting&text=Getting%20told%20there's%20a%20problem,passwords%20to%20your%20online%20accounts).

# Goal & Aims
This Do-It-Yourself (DIY) course is designed to provide a basic grounding of AI based on Data Science principles & practices. In doing so, we provide hands-on experience with cloud computing by providing acces to the [LISA-cluster](https://www.surf.nl/files/2019-03/lisa-compute-cluster.pdf) from the Dutch national compute center SURFsara. That is students get access to data Science coding tools via the [JupyterHub for Education service](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/JupyterHub+for+education) of [SURF.nl](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/).

The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills and neuroscience principles in order to complete basic AI-modeling scenario's covering NLP, CV and RL.

# LESSON TWO: Defining AI & the Human Condition

In this lession we explore how to define AI from the prespective of what us defines as human beings: 

## "THE HUMAN CONDITION"
