# Digital-Humans
How can global digital platforms scale their world-wide services to meet people's needs & wants, within the context of the human condition? Creative industries are adressing this seemingly paradox by developing agent-based solutions such as intelligent assistants, voice bots and smart objects that can converse convincingly with people  thanks to recent advances in AI-technologies. The most prominent of which are: pre-trainded deep-learning transfomer-models like BERT, BLOOM & GTP-3 [https://robfvdw.medium.com/a-generic-approach-to-data-driven-activities-d85ad558b5fa].

# Goal & Aims
This Do-it-Yourself (DIY) course is designed to provide a basic grounding of AI based on Data Science principles & practices.

The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills and neuroscience principles in order to complete basic AI-modeling scenario's:

* creating a chat-bot (natural Laguage processing) [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-intelligent-chatbot-in-python-using-the-spacy-nlp-library]
* facial expession recognition (computer vision) [https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-emotion-recognition-from-facial-expressions-using-python-64e58d4324ff] 
* ML-agents (reinforcement learning) [https://www.gocoder.one/blog/introduction-to-unity-ml-agents].

# LESSON ZERO: Data Science Basics & JupyterHub Cloud Computing



# LESSON TWO: Defining AI & the Human Condition

https://github.com/robvdw/Digital-Humans/blob/main/LESSONS/ZERO/DATA_SCIENCE_BASICS_SEPT_2022sec..pdf

In this lession we explore how to define AI from the prespective of what us defines as human beings: "THE HUMAN CONDITION".
